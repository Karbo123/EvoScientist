"""Deployed graph entry for the main EvoScientist agent.

The main ``EvoScientist_agent`` is exposed via ``__getattr__`` lazy loading
in ``EvoScientist/EvoScientist.py`` so it doesn't construct on plain
``import EvoScientist``. ``langgraph dev`` 's symbol resolver inspects
module attributes directly and doesn't trigger ``__getattr__``, so we
define a lazy factory here to make it visible.

When the lazy factory builds the graph, we upgrade the compiled graph's
class in place to ``_EvoFilteredGraph``, which strips
``PrivateStateAttr``-marked fields (currently just
``_quickjs_snapshot_payload``) from ``get_state`` / ``get_state_history``
responses. Upstream ``langchain_quickjs`` annotates
the field ``PrivateStateAttr = OmitFromSchema(input=True, output=True)``,
but LangGraph's ``_prepare_state_snapshot`` doesn't honor that on
checkpoint reads — every ``getState`` materializes the delta chain back
into a full ~1.4 MB blob, which the WebUI then downloads. The subclass
closes the gap without touching the middleware's write path, preserving
cross-turn REPL persistence as ``langchain-ai/deepagents#3064`` shipped it.

def _strip_private(snap):
    """Strip ``PrivateStateAttr``-marked fields from a ``StateSnapshot``.

    Empirically verified against a live history response for a thread with
    a single touched turn: the private field leaks on four surfaces — three
    trivial, one heavy:

    * ``snap.values`` — the materialized channel state exposed as the main
      payload. For DeltaChannels this is the delta chain replayed into full
      bytes (~1.4 MB for the quickjs snapshot). ``get_state`` and every
      history entry.
    * ``snap.metadata['writes']`` — ``{node_name: {channel: value}}`` map of
      the raw writes that produced each checkpoint. On the ``after_agent``
      step that first snapshots the REPL, ``value`` is the encoded write
      record ``("snap", full_bytes)`` ≈ 1.4 MB.
    * ``snap.tasks[*].result`` — the return dict of each completed
      ``PregelTask``. ``after_agent`` returns
      ``{"_quickjs_snapshot_payload": ("snap", bytes)}``; this dict becomes
      the task's ``result`` field, which the API surfaces verbatim under
      ``tasks[*].result`` (``langgraph_api.state:106``). This is the
      dominant leak: 1.7 MB in the last history entry of any thread whose
      most-recent-in-window checkpoint had a snapshot anchor.
    * ``snap.metadata['counters_since_delta_snapshot']`` — DeltaChannel's
      snapshot cadence bookkeeping ``{channel: [count, superstep]}``. Tiny
      (~20 B) but exposes the private field name; strip for cleanliness.
    * ``snap.tasks[*].state`` (nested ``StateSnapshot``) — populated when the
      caller passes ``subgraphs=True``. Repeats all of the above surfaces
      for each subgraph task, so recurse into it. Not exercised by the
      current WebUI (which doesn't pass ``subgraphs=True`` on REST reads),
      but SDK / curl / gRPC callers can.

    ``Pregel.copy`` uses ``self.__class__(**attrs)`` so this subclass
    survives the ``graph_obj.copy(update=...)`` call in
    ``langgraph_api.graph.get_graph`` that binds the checkpointer / store
    before yielding to endpoint handlers.

    **Known gap — streaming paths.** The overrides only cover ``get_state``
    / ``get_state_history``. On this compiled graph,
    ``self.output_channels`` correctly excludes ``_quickjs_snapshot_payload``
    (respects ``OmitFromSchema(output=True)``), but
    ``self.stream_channels_asis`` includes it alongside other private
    fields (``jump_to``, ``_summarization_event``) — the two lists are
    built by ``langgraph.graph.state``'s graph builder and only the first
    checks the output schema. So a client streaming with
    ``stream_mode="values"`` or ``stream_mode="events"`` (which fall back
    to ``stream_channels_asis`` when ``output_keys`` is ``None``) can pull
    the anchor blob in per-run event data. Empirically the WebUI's
    ``stream_mode=["updates"]`` path is clean, so this is transient per-run
    rather than the persistent per-getState download this PR targets.
    Filter here first; extend into the stream layer if a client relying on
    ``values`` / ``events`` reports it.
